        <h4>
          Greek-style yoghurt tends to be thicker and creamier than plain
          natural yoghurt, but is it worth plumping for the expensive versions
          or will budget do?
        </h4>

        <p>
          We compared three Greek yoghurts with very different price points -
          all sold at Tesco - to find out if paying more pays off.
          <br />
          A large panel of consumer taste testers blind-sampled each yoghurt,
          rating each on smell, look, taste and texture to determine their
          favourite.

          What is the difference between Greek yoghurt and Greek-style yoghurt?
        </h3>

        <p>
          Both Greek and Greek-style yoghurts are similar, being thicker and
          creamier than plain natural yoghurt, but authentic Greek yoghurt goes
          through an extensive straining process, which reduces the amount of
          watery whey and results in a thicker, more nutrient-packed yoghurt.
          <br />
          Greek-style yoghurt, however, is typically less thick, with a softer
          consistency. It can be thickened with milk powders to emulate the
          texture of the real thing. This usually makes it cheaper, but gives it
          a different nutrition profile.
          <br />
          It may not be for you if you're keen on the true thick Greek yoghurt,
          but you may find it more palatable than plain natural yoghurt, where
          cheaper versions can be quite sharp and watery.
